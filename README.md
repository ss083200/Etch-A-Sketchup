# Etch-A-Sketchup
"Etch-A-Sketchup" is a Python script that enables users to draw curves and shapes on a digital canvas, offering a creative and interactive experience reminiscent of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

Description:
The "Etch-A-Sketchup" GitHub repository contains a Python script that allows users to draw curves and shapes on a digital canvas, inspired by the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. With this script, you can create intricate drawings and geometric designs using simple keyboard inputs.

The script utilizes the Turtle module, which provides a straightforward way to create graphics and animations in Python. By capturing keyboard inputs, users can control the movement of the turtle, thereby drawing curves and shapes on the canvas.

Key Features:
Drawing Curves: The script allows users to draw smooth curves by moving the turtle on the canvas.
Creating Shapes: Users can construct various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, and polygons, using the provided functions and keyboard inputs.
Interactive and Responsive: The turtle's movements are displayed in real-time, allowing users to visualize their drawings as they progress.
Canvas Reset: The script provides functionality to clear the canvas and start fresh, enabling users to create new drawings or correct mistakes.
Save and Export: Users can save their artwork as an image file, allowing them to preserve their creations or share them with others.
Dependencies:
The script relies on the Turtle module, which is part of the Python standard library. Therefore, no additional external dependencies are required.

Usage:
To utilize the "Etch-A-Sketchup" script, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. Execute the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter. Once the graphical window opens, you can utilize the following keyboard inputs to draw curves and shapes:

Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the turtle, drawing curves as it moves.
Press "S" to draw a square.
Press "R" to draw a rectangle.
Press "C" to draw a circle.
Press "T" to draw a triangle.
Press "P" to draw a polygon with a customizable number of sides.
Press "E" to activate the eraser tool and erase portions of the drawing.
Press "X" to clear the entire canvas and start anew.
To save your artwork, press a designated keyboard key, and the image file will be saved to your local directory.
